## Feature requests and bugs

If you find any problems or have an idea for a new feature, please let us know in [Issues](https://github.com/fus1ondev/EjectKey/issues).

Before posting a new issue, Don't forget to check if the same one already exists.

Any pull requests are also welcome. 

## Localization

Currently, English and Japanese localizations are offered.

If you can help us improve translations or support new languages, please post [an issue](https://github.com/fus1ondev/EjectKey/issues) or [a pull request](https://github.com/fus1ondev/EjectKey/pulls).

[Localization Editor](https://github.com/igorkulman/iOSLocalizationEditor) is recommended for editing `Localizable.strings`.

## Coding Style

Please match the existing coding style as much as possible.

## Build Locally

You must have Xcode, SwiftLint and SwiftGen installed in your Mac.

You can install SwiftLint and SwiftGen from Homebrew.

```sh
brew install swiftgen swiftlint

git clone https://github.com/fus1ondev/EjectKey.git

cd EjectKey/

mkdir EjectKey/Generated
```

`EjectKey/Generated/Strings.swift` will be generated by SwiftGen during build, so you have to create the `EjectKey/Generated` directory before doing it.

After that, you can build it with Xcode.
